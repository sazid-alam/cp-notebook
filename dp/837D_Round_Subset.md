# D. Round Subset (Codeforces 837D)

### üîó Problem
- **Name:** D. Round Subset  
- **Link / Source:** https://codeforces.com/contest/837/problem/D  
- **Tags:** dp, knapsack, optimization, trailing-zeros

### üí° Key Idea
- You have `n` numbers (flowers), each with powers of 2 and 5.  
- Goal: pick exactly `k` numbers to maximize the number of trailing zeros in their product.  
- Trailing zeros = `min(total_2s, total_5s)` for the chosen numbers.  
- **Trick:** Fix total number of 5s and then maximize total 2s ‚Äî classic knapsack-style DP.

---

### üß© Pattern
- **DP State:** `dp[five][j]` = maximum number of 2s we can get by choosing exactly `j` numbers using total of `five` 5s.  
- **Base case:** `dp[0][0] = 0` ‚Üí choosing 0 numbers uses 0 5s and gives 0 2s.  
- **Transition (for each number i):**
  - Let `v[i].ff = 2s`, `v[i].ss = 5s`.
  - Skip: `dp[five][j]` unchanged.  
  - Take: `dp[five][j] = max(dp[five][j], dp[five - v[i].ss][j-1] + v[i].ff)`  
    (only if `five >= v[i].ss` and `dp[five - v[i].ss][j-1] != -1`)  

- **Loop order:**  
  - `i = 1..n` ‚Üí each number  
  - `five = MAX..0` ‚Üí backward to avoid using the current number multiple times  
  - `j = k..1` ‚Üí backward to avoid using the current number multiple times  
  - Backward loops ensure each number is counted at most once.

### üìù Pseudocode
```cpp
dp[0][0] = 0
for i = 1..n:  // each number
    for five = MAX..0:
        for j = k..1:
            if five >= v[i].ss and dp[five - v[i].ss][j-1] != -1:
                dp[five][j] = max(dp[five][j], dp[five - v[i].ss][j-1] + v[i].ff)

// compute answer
ans = 0
for five = 0..MAX:
    if dp[five][k] != -1:
        ans = max(ans, min(five, dp[five][k]))
print(ans)
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Mistakes
- ‚ùå **Initial mistake:** Didn‚Äôt recognize it as a knapsack problem at first; tried solving like a normal DP without fixing 5s.  
- ‚ùå **Base case issues:** Had some mistakes with initializing `dp[0][0]`.  
- ‚ùå **Loop order mistakes:** Forward loops for `j` and `five` caused double-counting the same number.  
- ‚úÖ **Correction:** Fix 5s as one dimension, then maximize 2s; use backward loops for `j` and `five` to prevent duplicates.  
- üí° **Learning:**  
  - For ‚Äúchoose exactly k items‚Äù problems, backward loops prevent double-counting.  
  - When optimizing a function of multiple factors (2s & 5s), fixing one dimension and optimizing the other is a useful trick.  
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Complexity:** O(n * MAX * k), where MAX is total possible 5s.
