### 💡 Key Idea
- The problem reduces to minimizing the number of operations needed to reduce a value `k` to `0`, where each operation type `i` effectively reduces the remaining amount by `(a[i] - b[i])` and costs `2` (with some special lower bound behavior).
- Recognize it as a **knapsack/coin-change-like** problem: repeatedly apply operations to decrease `k`.
- **Optimization trick:** instead of applying operations one-by-one, compute how many times (`p`) you can safely apply the chosen operation in one jump (batching) — this drastically reduces the number of states.
- Precompute, for each possible value `x`, the best operation index to use (using a greedy ordering), then use memoized recursion (map) for queries.

---

### 🧩 Pattern
- **Knapsack-style DP + greedy preselection.**  
- Precompute a `best[x]` array mapping `x` → index of the operation that is the most suitable for values ≥ `x` (using a sort by `(a - b)`), then solve queries with memoized recursion that jumps multiple operations at once.

### 📝 Pseudocode
```cpp
function solve(k):
    if k == 0: return 0
    if dp contains k: return dp[k]

    idx = best[min(k, MAX-1)]
    if idx == -1: return dp[k] = 0

    step = a[idx] - b[idx]
    p = (k - b[idx] - 1) / step
    if p == 0: p = 1

    new_k = k - p * step
    dp[k] = 2 * p + solve(new_k)
    return dp[k]

// Answer = sum of solve(k) for all queries
